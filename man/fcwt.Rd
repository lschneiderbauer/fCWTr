\usage{
fcwt(
  signal,
  sample_freq,
  n_freqs,
  freq_begin = 2 * sample_freq/length(signal),
  freq_end = sample_freq/2,
  sigma = 1,
  remove_coi = TRUE,
  nthreads = 8L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{signal}{Real-valued time series. The time steps are assumed to be evenly spaced.}

\item{sample_freq}{Sampling rate of input time series. This number primarily establishes
a connection to physical units which is used in other frequency definitions
as well as the units of the output data.}

\item{n_freqs}{Number of frequency bins generated by the CWT. The frequencies
are linearly distributed. Computation time increases when raising the
number of frequency bins.}

\item{freq_begin, freq_end}{Optionally specifies the frequency range \verb{[freq_end, freq_begin]}. If not
specified the maximal meaningful frequency range, depending on the input signal,
is taken.
The range and \code{sample_freq} need to be specified in the same units.}

\item{sigma}{Sets a dimensionless parameter modifying the wavelet spread which in the
time-domain is roughly given by \eqn{\Sigma_t \sim \sqrt{2} \frac{\sigma}{f}}.
Changing this parameter adjusts the time/frequency uncertainty balance.
Defaults to 1.
Larger (lower) value of sigma corresponds to a better (worse) frequency
resolution and a worse (better) time resolution.}

\item{remove_coi}{Boundary effects can result in nonphysical artifacts. If \code{remove_coi = TRUE},
those are effectively removed by setting corresponding values to \code{NA}.
We define the essential support of the
(Gaussian) wavelet to be four times its standard deviation,
\eqn{4 \Sigma_t = 2 * \sqrt{2} \frac{\sigma}{f}}, and so a wavelet touches
the boundary if the distance of the center of the wavelet to the boundary
is less then \eqn{4 \Sigma_t}. Values that fall into that range are removed
if \code{remove_coi = TRUE}.}

\item{nthreads}{Number of threads used by the computation, if supported by your platform.}
}
\value{
The spectogram, a numeric real-valued matrix with dimensions
\code{dim = c(length(signal), n_freqs)}.
}
\description{
The core function of this package making use of the fcwt library. It processes
an input signal in form of a real valued numeric vector interpreted as an
evenly spaced time series and returns the absolute values of a spectogram,
i.e. a graph with a time and a frequency dimension.
}
\details{
The wavelet used in this calculation is the so called Morlet wavelet,
a sinusoidal wave modulated by a Gaussian whose spread is controlled by
the argument \code{sigma}.
