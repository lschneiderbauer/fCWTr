## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added missing documentation for return values and being more elaborate with already existing return value documentation.

* Added single quotes in the DESCRIPTION where appropriate.

* Changed the package title from 'fcwtr' to 'fCWTr' to be more consistent with the original author's library name. Various URLs and package references were adjusted accordingly.


## R CMD check results

* This is a new release.
* Note: "Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION: Broek (17:32) Lukas (16:57)." I double-checked the spelling and it is correct.
